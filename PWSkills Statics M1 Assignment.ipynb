    "1. Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss  nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\n",
    "Data can be classified into qualitative (categorical) and quantitative (numerical) types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative Data: Represents categories or labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Colors of cars (red, blue, black).\n",
    "Quantitative Data: Represents numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Heights of students in a class.\n",
    "Scales of Measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal: Categories without order (e.g., gender, eye color).\n",
    "Ordinal: Categories with order but no fixed difference (e.g., rankings).\n",
    "Interval: Ordered data with equal differences, but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n",
    "Ratio: Ordered data with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median,  and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures describe the center of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The average of all values. Used for symmetrical data (e.g., test scores).\n",
    "Median: The middle value when data is arranged in order. Used for skewed data (e.g., income distribution).\n",
    "Mode: The most frequently occurring value. Used for categorical data (e.g., most common shoe size)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersion measures how spread out data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The average squared difference from the mean.\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, showing how much data deviates from the mean.\n",
    "Higher dispersion means more variability in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot is a graphical representation of data distribution. It shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Median (Q2) – Middle value.\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR) – Middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "Whiskers – Minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR.\n",
    "Outliers – Extreme values beyond whiskers.\n",
    "It helps visualize data distribution, skewness, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random sampling ensures that every individual in a population has an equal chance of selection. This helps in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing bias.\n",
    "Making valid inferences about a population.\n",
    "Improving accuracy of statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness measures the asymmetry of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Skew (Right Skew): Tail on the right; mean > median (e.g., salaries).\n",
    "Negative Skew (Left Skew): Tail on the left; mean < median (e.g., exam scores).\n",
    "Skewness affects statistical analysis by shifting central tendency values\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "IQR = Q3 - Q1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1 = 25th percentile\n",
    "Q3 = 75th percentile\n",
    "Detecting Outliers:\n",
    "Any value below Q1 - 1.5 × IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 × IQR is considered an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binomial distribution applies when:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a fixed number of trials (n).\n",
    "Each trial has two outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "The probability of success (p) remains constant.\n",
    "Trials are independent.\n",
    "Example: Tossing a coin 10 times and counting heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. The empirical rule states:\n",
    "\n",
    "68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "95% within 2σ.\n",
    "99.7% within 3σ.\n",
    "Used in natural phenomena like height and IQ scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Poisson process models rare events over a fixed interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Number of emails received per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "If emails arrive at an average rate of 5 per hour, the probability of receiving exactly 3 emails in an hour is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=3x)=(e^-5 * 5^3)/3! , this is congruent to 0.14\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Explain what a random variable is and differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable represents numerical outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete: Takes specific values (e.g., number of heads in 10 coin tosses).\n",
    "Continuous: Takes any value in a range (e.g., height of students).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Provide an example dataset, calculate both covariance and correlation, and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "X\tY\n",
    "2\t4\n",
    "3\t6\n",
    "5\t10\n",
    "Covariance Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋,𝑌)=∑(𝑋𝑖−𝑋)(𝑌𝑖−𝑌ˉ)/𝑛−1\n",
    "Cov(X,\n",
    " \n",
    "Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑟=𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋,𝑌)/𝜎𝑋 𝜎𝑌\n",
    " \n",
    "Covariance shows the direction of the relationship.\n",
    "Correlation (range -1 to 1) shows strength and direction.\n"
